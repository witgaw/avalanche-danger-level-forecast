### Ideas

There's an [avalanche map](https://www.sais.gov.uk/avalanche_map/?area=-1&type=All) available, perhaps it could be scraped for some additional information to do with aspects and angles?

### Questions

- Where can 'Avalanche Code' and 'AV cat' be looked-up?
  - Seems this relate to observed avalanches
- How to I decipher 'Grid'? They all seem to point to somewhere in Celtic Sea - so somehow wrong, but not entirely so (as it's close-ish)?
